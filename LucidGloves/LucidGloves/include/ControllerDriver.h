This class controls the behavior of the controller. This is where you 
tell OpenVR what your controller has (buttons, joystick, trackpad, etc.).
This is also where you inform OpenVR when the state of your controller 
changes (for example, a button is pressed).

For the methods, take a look at the comment blocks for the ITrackedDeviceServerDriver 
class too. Those comment blocks have some good information.

	return the IVRDriverInput class, but it could return other component classes if it had 
	more functionality, such as maybe overlays or UI functionality.
